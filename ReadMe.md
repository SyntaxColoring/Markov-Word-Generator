====
1. [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script) is cool.
2. [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) is cool.
3. [Markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are cool.

There are plenty of sites that use Markov chains to semi-legible *paragraphs*, but not a whole lot that use them to generate semi-legible *words.*
